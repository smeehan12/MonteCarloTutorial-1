# MonteCarloTutorial

# the first file(assignment_1) is the code for the first assignment 
## we are excepeting to get a sample that is uniformally distributed and a histogram to demonstrate that. 
### to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"

# the second file(assignment_2) is the code for second assignment
## we simply want to generate angles that are normally distributed using the method accept and reject.
### to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"

# In the third (Calculation of pi) we used the method accept and reject again to calculate the value of "pi".
## to run the code go to clone or download and the type this on your terminal window "python3 'file_name.py'" without the quotation marks"
### Here we also there is a part in which we try to see the uncertainity in our calculation which comes with a histogram thats comes after the first one from the pi calculation this histogram is showing the uncertainty of the calculation when try different ways of sampling.
