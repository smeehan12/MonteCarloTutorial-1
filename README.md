# MonteCarloTutorial

# Assignment 1 : Random Distribution
The first file (`1st_assignment.py`) is the code for the first assignment 
## How to Execute
First clone the repository and then run
```
python3 1st_assignment.py
```
## Output
We are excepeting to get a sample that is uniformally distributed and a histogram to demonstrate that. 


# Assignment 2 : Random Gaussian Numbers
The second file (`2nd_assignment.py`) is the code for second assignment
## How to Execute
First clone the repository and then run
```
python3 2nd_assignment.py
```
## Output
We simply want to generate angles that are normally distributed using the method accept and reject.

# Assignment 3 : Calculation of \pi
We used the method accept and reject again to calculate the value of "pi".

## How to Execute
to run the code go to clone or download and then run
```
python3 Calculation_of_pi.py
```

## Output
- The program will first output a histogram of the calculation of \pi for 1000 trials.
- Here we also there is a part in which we try to see the uncertainity in our calculation which comes with a histogram thats comes after the first one from the pi calculation this histogram is showing the uncertainty of the calculation when try different ways of sampling.

# 2D Parton Shower
A  2D simulation of the parton shower.

## How to Execute
to run the code go to clone or download and then run
```
python3	2D_graphics.py
```
Here also in the file we have the (1/x) distribution of \theta and z and these can be tuned by the user

## Output
We are excepecting to see a 2d graph of a parton shower.

# 3D Parton Shower
Simulation of a 3D parton shower

## How to Execute
to run the code go to clone or download and then run
```
python3 partonshower3d.py
```

## Output
We excepecting to see a 3D plot of a parton shower and a csv file contains the data with the name `parton_<Date>.csv`
